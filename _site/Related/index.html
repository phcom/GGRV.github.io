    <h2 id="intp-quantifying-cross-application-interference-in-smp-machines-via-resource-driven-instrumentation">IntP: Quantifying cross-application interference in SMP machines via resource-driven instrumentation</h2>

<p>Large-scale virtual datacenters host tens of thousands of diverse applications each day. However, resource contention-related interference between co-located applications
and the difficulty to match them to one of the many hardware platforms can degrade performance, affecting the quality of
service and compromising user experience. Understanding the sources of noise that harm performance and better managing where application are hosted can significantly impact how datacenters operate. This paper presents the <strong>IntP</strong> — an instrumentation tool to quantify the level of interference an application puts on each hardware’s subsystem. IntP not only measures the
amount of noise an application is susceptible and the interference
applications causes one another, but also points out which source of noise is more disturbing performance. This instrumentation
enables accurate prediction of the performance degradation that results from contention on shared resources. In addition,
it provides outputs for better application placement strategies, which makes datacenter resource efficient and more cost effective.</p>

<h2 id="policies-for-interference-and-affinity-aware-placement-of-multi-tier-applications-in-private-cloud-infrastructures">Policies for Interference and Affinity-Aware Placement of Multi-tier Applications in Private Cloud Infrastructures</h2>

<p>There are a significant number of research works focusing on the placement of cloud applications. While some of these works take into consideration performance, most of them are concerned about reducing infrastructure costs. Besides, <strong>none of them</strong> take into consideration the interference and network affinity characteristics. In this case, it was created a placements policies that aim to improve the performance of multi-tier applications by analyzing the interference and network affinity characteristics of each tier. These characteristics work as a force pushing tiers closer or farther depending on the interference and affinity levels. This work used <strong>IntP</strong> outputs as the parameters to measure the interference levels that the application creates on the infrastructure. Furthermore, by using these placement policies, it was shown that multi-tier applications could better utilize resources using the same infrastructure but with improved performance or with better distribution of application tiers.</p>
